1. Description
	1. with the given number argument, return an array of strings that contains all the simplified fractions where the denominator is less than or equal to the argument
2. first attempt
	1. have a returnArr to contain the fractions in string form
	2. numerator: have a for loop that iterates up to given (argument -1)
	3. denominator: have another for loop that iterates up to the given argument
	4. find the common denominator between the two numbers, if there is a CD, then do not include it in the returnArr
	5. Some contraints for including the fraction
		- if denominator is 1 - then it number bigger than 1
		- i must not equal j - if they are equal, they are a whole number
		- i must not equal 0 - or it is 0
		- i must be less than j - or it is bigger than 1
	1. I did not know how to find the common denominator that is divisible by both numbers
```
var simplifiedFractions = function(n) {
    let returnArr = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            let denom = gcd(i, j);
            let fraction = `${i}/${j}`;
            if(denom == 1 && i !== j && i!== 0 && i<j) returnArr.push(fraction);
        }
    }
    return returnArr;
};

function gcd( a,  b)
{
    if (a == 0)
        return b;
    return gcd(b % a, a);
}
```
3. I couldn't think of a faster more optimal solution. This would be n squared due to iterating over n twice.
