1. Description
	1. argument is an array that contains elements that represent number of gifts in a pile 
	2. second argument represents seconds, or the number of times the piles of gifts are chosen
	3. for each second, find the square root and leave that many gifts in the pile
	4. return the total number of gifts remaining after taking all the gifts in piles according to second argument
2. First Attempt
3. 
	1. ```var pickGifts = function(gifts, k) {
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++){
        let largest = Math.max(...gifts);
        let indexOfLargest = gifts.indexOf(largest);
        gifts[indexOfLargest] = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(largest));
    }
    return gifts.reduce((a,b)=> a+b, 0)
    };```
4. Summary
	1. I'm not sure this is the most optimal solution since I'm using Math.max on every iteration of k. This would add n time complexity every time it's called.
	2. This would be nsquared time complexity
