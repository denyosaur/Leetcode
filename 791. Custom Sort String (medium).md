https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/
1. order the second argument accordingly using the character order in the order argument
2. First attempt
	1. create a dictionary for s string that counts the each characters and count of characters
		1. create a for loop making this dictionary for the s argument
	2. have an empty string that is to be returned
	3. after dictionary is filled
		1. create a for loop over the order argument to create the order
		2. in the for loop, create a while loop that will run as long as dictionary has matching letter to the current order[i]
			3. in the while loop, add the order[i] characetr to the return string
			4. in the while loop, if decrement the order[i] in dictionary, if it's 0, delete the key value pair
	4. another while loop to add in the characters that were not specified in the order string
		1. with the left over characters in dictionary, iterate over using Object.keys(dict).forEach
			1. add the character to returnStr
			2. decrement dict[key] if greater than 1 decrement it
			3. otherwise delete the key value pair
	5. return returnStr
```
var customSortString = function(order, s) {
    let dict = {}
    let returnStr = ''
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if(!dict[s[i]]) {
            dict[s[i]] = 1;
        } else {
            dict[s[i]] +=1;
        }
    }

    for (let i = 0; i< order.length; i++) {
        while (dict[order[i]] && dict[order[i]] > 0) {
            returnStr += order[i]
            if (dict[order[i]] > 1) {
                dict[order[i]] -= 1;
            } else {
                delete dict[order[i]];
            }

        }
    }

    while (Object.keys(dict).length > 0) {
        Object.keys(dict).forEach((key)=> {
            returnStr += key
            if (dict[key] > 1) {
                dict[key] -= 1;
            } else {
                delete dict[key];
            }
        })
    }
    
    return returnStr;
};
```
3. This is not the optimal solution, it is iterating over order, n, and s which would lead to n-squared
